a) Informal Resolution for You Disputes
With respect to any Dispute, you agree to attempt to negotiate the resolution of any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or other proceeding, including any legal proceeding in court or before an administrative agency. Such informal negotiations commence upon SkyQOL’s receipt of Notice from you. This does not apply to any Dispute that SkyQOL has with You.
b) Contact Information
SkyQOL can be reached at support.SkyQOL.net, or contact the SkyQOL Support Team directly through the Help Desk at support.SkyQOL.net.
c) Mandatory Binding Arbitration for Your Disputes
If you are not able to satisfactorily resolve a Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, or if SkyQOL, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that it will not be possible to satisfactorily resolve that Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, you agree that either you or SkyQOL may request resolution by final and fully binding arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. You may request that a Dispute be resolved by arbitration under this Section shall be responsible for initiating such a proceeding.
The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will run the arbitration between you and SkyQOL, and AAA’s rules and procedures (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) will be used. If something in these Terms is different than AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms instead. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.
YOU UNDERSTAND, AND FURTHER AGREE, THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING REGARDING THIS AND ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL ELIMINATE YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH DISPUTE. You and SkyQOL both agree that neither shall attempt to have any other arbitration or class action related to any other party joined to any arbitration in which you are involved with SkyQOL. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration proceeding shall be decided on a class-action basis or utilizing class action procedures.

e) Once you download the mod, you're obligated to share your information with SkyQOL Inc.
f) If you are going to make allegations, claims, or any sort of mention of someone doing anything negative, you must have extremely proficient proof. It's not enough for anyone to have just said it, unless of course the person you are claiming to have done that said it themselves. Having a member of the discord claim something happened is not nearly enough proof.
g) Your all property(except debt) belongs to SkyQOL or mod creator after you download the mod.
h) You agreed not to pursue legal responsibility by anything caused by the mod or the mod creator or SkyQOL.
11) Miscellaneous
a) Changes

f) Remedies
You acknowledge and agree that any violation or threatened violation of this agreement will cause irreparable injury to SkyQOL, entitling SkyQOL to seek injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.
